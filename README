R5U87x Userspace Tools
Version 0.1.0, 2008/09/30

Introduction
============

This project is an attempt to produce a group of useful usespace tools for
managing cameras based on Ricoh R5U87x chipsets.

You will still need to depend on such kernel drivers like uvcvideo to get the
video stream out of the device.

Supported devices
=================

See docs/model_matrix.txt

Compilation
===========

To compile the tools, it is required you have the following prerequisites
installed:

 * GCC
 * Make
 * libusb development packages (libusb-dev or similar)
 * GLib 2.0 development packages (libglib2.0-dev or similar)

Compilation itself is reasonably simple; just run make:
 $ make

Usage
=====

To upload the firmware to your camera, simply run (possibly as root, depending
on your system):
  $ ./loader

Do note that this only lasts while the camera still has power to it. Shutting
down and starting up again will cause the camera to lose its state. Rebooting,
however, won't.

You may need to reload your kernel module (eg. uvcvideo) for it to notice your
camera now that it has firmware.

If your camera appears to be playing up, you can try forcefully resetting it:
  $ ./loader --force-clear

There are also useful arguments for testing, see doc/extracting_ucode.txt

Bugs
====

Please, report any bugs by creating a new ticket at 
http://www.bitbucket.org/ahixon/r5u87x/issues/new/. If possible, make sure
that the bug you have hasn't already been reported by searching the issue list.

Additional thanks to those who helped Sam develop the driver.

Thanks to Utz-Uwe Haus for getting the Sony VGP-VCC7 firmware extracted, and
providing a patch against the original r5u870 driver, and providing the
recode-fw.scm script.

Some friendly folk on the Ubuntu Forums for providing extracted version of
firmwares and their associated version numbers.

Thanks to 'franz' for providing an updated version of 183b driver, and testing.
