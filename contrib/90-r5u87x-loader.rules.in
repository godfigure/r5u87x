# r5u87x-loader.rules - udev rules for loading firmware into Ricoh R5U87x USB video devices
###
### This file is processed by the debian rules to create the final file. Each
### USB id gets its own line as defined by the section between BEGINTEMPLATE
### and ENDTEMPLATE. In the template, the strings #VENDORID# and #PRODUCTID#
### are replaced by their values. This template line is repeated for each
### USB for which there is a file in the directory ucode/.
###
### Lines starting with three hashes are removed from this file.
